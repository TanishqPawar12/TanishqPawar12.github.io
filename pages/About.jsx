          <Text>Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m <span className="highlight">Tanishq Pawar</span>, a final year B.Tech. student (2022â€“25) from <span className="highlight">Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research, Indore</span>, pursuing Computer Science & Engineering.</Text>

          <Text>From being an ambivert kid who used to quietly observe the world around him to becoming someone whoâ€™s building real-world tech solutions â€” my journey has been all about <span className="highlight">growth through curiosity</span> and <span className="highlight">learning by doing</span>.</Text>

          <Text>I wasnâ€™t someone who always knew heâ€™d be in tech. But things started changing when I began exploring how websites work, how logic turns into code, and how digital products shape the world. The turning point? Probably during the lockdown â€” when most people were binge-watching, I was busy binge-learning. I discovered <span className="highlight">Web Development</span>, and it felt like something clicked.</Text>

          <Text>Since then, Iâ€™ve dived deep into <span className="highlight">ReactJS, Tailwind.css</span>, and slowly started understanding the backend ecosystem too. I built multiple projects, including one thatâ€™s very close to my heart â€” <span className="highlight">Giftible.in</span>, an e-commerce platform that showcases products crafted by specially-abled children. It was more than just a college project; it gave me purpose.</Text>

          <Text>I believe in <span className="highlight">consistency over perfection</span>. Iâ€™m not the smartest person in the room, but Iâ€™m always the one who will <span className="highlight">keep showing up</span>, keep learning, and keep iterating. Whether it's solving a DSA problem or exploring how <span className="highlight">DevOps</span> will shape my future career â€” Iâ€™m in it for the long haul.</Text>

          <Text>Some life lessons that I carry with me:</Text>
          <UnorderedList pl={4}>
            <ListItem>Growth starts where comfort ends.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>You donâ€™t need motivation every day â€” you just need discipline.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Itâ€™s okay to not know everything, but itâ€™s not okay to stop being curious.</ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
        </VStack>
